      <h2>Basic Rules of Texas Hold'em</h2>
      <p>Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant. Here's how to play:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Blinds:</strong> The game begins with two players posting the "blinds" - forced bets that start the betting.</li>
        <li><strong>The Deal:</strong> Each player receives two private cards (known as "hole cards").</li>
        <li><strong>First Betting Round:</strong> Starting with the player after the big blind, each player can call, raise, or fold.</li>
        <li><strong>The Flop:</strong> Three community cards are dealt face up.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Betting Round:</strong> Another round of betting occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>The Turn:</strong> A fourth community card is dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Betting Round:</strong> Another round of betting.</li>
        <li><strong>The River:</strong> The fifth and final community card is dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Betting Round:</strong> The last betting round.</li>
        <li><strong>The Showdown:</strong> If more than one player remains, cards are shown and the best five-card hand wins.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Players make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
      <h2>The Button and Blinds</h2>
      <p>The dealer position and blinds are fundamental to poker structure:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Button:</strong> A disk that marks the theoretical dealer position. The button rotates clockwise after each hand. The player on the button acts last in all post-flop betting rounds, giving them a strategic advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Blind:</strong> The player to the immediate left of the button must post the small blind, usually half the minimum bet. This is a forced bet that must be made before receiving any cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Big Blind:</strong> The player to the left of the small blind must post the big blind, equal to the minimum bet. Like the small blind, this is a forced bet made before seeing any cards.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>After each hand, the button moves one position clockwise, and the blinds follow accordingly. This ensures that the advantage of position rotates fairly among all players.</p>

      <h2>Hand Rankings</h2>
      <p>In poker, hands are ranked from highest to lowest as shown in the image below:</p>

    <div class="rules-section">
      <h2>Betting Rules</h2>
      <p>When it's your turn to act, you have several options:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check:</strong> Pass the action to the next player (only if no bet has been made)</li>
        <li><strong>Bet/Raise:</strong> Place a bet or increase the current bet</li>
        <li><strong>Call:</strong> Match the current bet to stay in the hand</li>
        <li><strong>Fold:</strong> Discard your hand and forfeit any chance at the pot</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The betting continues clockwise around the table until all players have either called the current bet or folded.</p>

    <div class="rules-section">
      <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with low stakes games until you're comfortable with the rules</li>
        <li>Pay attention to your position at the table - playing late positions is advantageous</li>
        <li>Be selective about which starting hands you play</li>
        <li>Watch for betting patterns from your opponents</li>
        <li>Practice good bankroll management - never play with money you can't afford to lose</li>
        <li>Learn to calculate pot odds to make mathematically correct decisions</li>
      </ul>
